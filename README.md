# 💸 Daily Spending Predictor – Machine Learning Module

**Daily Spending Predictor** is a machine learning module that estimates users' daily spending limits based on their monthly income and savings goals. This project is part of the **Bangkit Academy 2024 Bacth 2 Capstone Project**, a program supported by Google, Traveloka, and Gojek.

> 📌 This repository contains the **prediction module (Dense Neural Network model)** developed by the Machine Learning team. The frontend application and cloud deployment are hosted in separate repositories.

## 🧠 About the Model

The prediction model is built using a **Dense Neural Network (DNN)**, trained to estimate daily spending limits based on the following inputs:

- Monthly income
- Monthly savings target
- (Optionally) historical spending ratio

The model is optimized and deployed to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** as a RESTful API service.
